# clippy.toml
# Configuration knobs for configurable Clippy lints.
# (The config file mechanism is considered unstable by Clippy docs.) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

# --- Size / complexity guardrails (your "phase 1") ---

# Flag functions/methods that are getting too long.
# Default is 100. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
too-many-lines-threshold = 120

# Flag functions with high cognitive complexity.
# Default is 25. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
cognitive-complexity-threshold = 20

# Flag blocks nested too deeply.
# IMPORTANT: This lint only triggers if you set a non-zero threshold (default is 0 = disabled). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
excessive-nesting-threshold = 7

# Flag functions that take “too many” arguments.
# Default is 7. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
too-many-arguments-threshold = 7

# Nudge you away from extremely complex types.
# Default is 250. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
type-complexity-threshold = 200


# --- Optional: tighten later if you like ---

# Encourage clearer naming if you want (default is 4).
# single-char-binding-names-threshold = 3

# If you start seeing a lot of "box it" / stack size lints and want control:
# stack-size-threshold = 512000
# array-size-threshold = 512000


# --- Optional: policy-enforcement (requires enabling the corresponding lints) ---

# These lists do nothing unless you also enable:
#   - clippy::disallowed_methods
#   - clippy::disallowed_types
#   - clippy::disallowed_macros
#
# Example patterns shown in Clippy docs. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

# disallowed-methods = [
#   "std::time::Instant::now",     # determinism
#   "rand::thread_rng",            # determinism
# ]
#
# disallowed-types = [
#   "std::collections::HashMap",   # if you want to force a deterministic map type in sim
# ]
#
# disallowed-macros = [
#   "println",                     # if you want to ban stdout debugging remnants
# ]
